# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
This project reviews stock data in Excel format from several green energy companies. Using VBA to automate stock analysis eliminating common repetitives calculations and providing clear and consistant results, so the data can be easily reviewed by finance advisors and their clients.

### Purpose
Facilitate financial analysis of stocks in Excel files by automating the analysis of each stock's yearly total volume and returns. Additionaly the analysis result's formatting will be integrated as part of the macro to ensure the results are inuser-friendly.

Given the nature of stock analysis, a larger number of companies and transacctions might be necessary in the future, therefore the initial code (see Green_Stocks_Analysis.xlsm) will be refactored to improve its efficiency. 


## Results
The initial version of the VBA code to automate stock analysis focus on simple readable code that would:
* Create identifiers for the information
*

*The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
